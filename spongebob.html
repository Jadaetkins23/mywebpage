<p> <font size="+2"> SpongeBob SquarePants is an American animated television series created by Stephen Hillenburg for Nickelodeon. Hillenburg is a marine biologist and animator. SpongeBob was originally going to be named SpongeBoy, and the series was to be called "SpongeBoy Ahoy!" but both of these names were already trademarked. Spongebob's personality was influenced by three people; Stan Laurel, Pee-wee Herman, and Jerry Lewis. </font> </p>
